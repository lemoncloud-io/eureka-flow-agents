 * Env-gated real-provider run of the full scenario matrix (list_nodes vs move_node selection, all

 * entirely unless BOTH `RUN_LIVE_PROVIDER_TESTS=1` is explicitly set AND the provider's key env
 * var is present — a key being set is no longer sufficient by itself, so a key left in the
 * environment for an unrelated reason can never trigger an accidental live run. Optionally narrow
 * to one provider with `LIVE_PROVIDER_FILTER=<providerId>` (combine with `<PROVIDER>_TEST_MODEL`
 * for one provider AND one model). Never hits the network in CI or a keyless/opted-out run, and no
 * key is ever read into a browser bundle (Node test env, `process.env` only) or logged.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT include a multi-step `list_nodes` -> `move_node` conversation: that needs
 * the real tool-result round-trip, a structurally different harness than this file's
 * single-`chat()`-call-per-scenario shape. This file's own matrix stays single-turn by design, not
 * because either provider can't do a second turn. See
 * docs/browser-agent/foundations/provider-tool-calling.md §4.
 *
 * Gemini has an observed lookup-first *target-resolution* strategy: given a prompt that requires
 * resolving a specific node, it may call `list_nodes` before committing to the scenario's expected
 * tool, even when the per-turn context it already received should make the lookup unnecessary.
 * The known-variance allowance for this covers every scenario that involves resolving a specific
 * node target — move-node-right/-left/-up/-down/-absolute, plus unknown-target — NOT
 * list-nodes-read-only (a different shape entirely: that scenario's own distinct variance is about
 * *not* calling list_nodes, the opposite direction) and NOT no-tool-refusal (no node-resolution
 * involved).
 *
 * Registry-driven: this file loops `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` (`../../llm/providerRegistry`) rather than
 * hard-coding one gateway-builder call per provider. Per entry, every model in
 * `resolveModelsToRun(entry, ...)` runs — every model in `entry.models` unless the entry's
 * `modelEnvOverride` env var narrows it to one. Concretely: setting only `OPENAI_API_KEY` runs the
 * full matrix against every model in `OPENAI_ENTRY.models`; set `OPENAI_TEST_MODEL` to pin to a
 * single model.
 *
 * **Timeout handling:** `runMatrix` races `runLocatorScenario` against its own internal timeout
 * (`DEFAULT_REAL_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, 30s, overridable per entry via `realTestTimeoutMs` — e.g. a slow
 * free-tier model) instead of relying on vitest's per-test timeout to catch a slow real API call.
 * This matters because vitest's own timeout aborts the test *before* any of this file's own code
 * runs — a scenario that timed out would never reach `rows.push(...)`, so it would be silently
 * absent from the matrix rather than counted, making `rows.length` itself smaller and letting e.g.
 * "6/6 accepted" hide 2 real timeouts that should have made it "6/8". The internal race always
 * wins first and always pushes a row (a `'timeout'` outcome, distinct from `'fail'`), so the
 * summary can never go quietly dishonest this way; vitest's own per-test timeout is still set
 * (comfortably higher, via `VITEST_TIMEOUT_BUFFER_MS`) purely as a backstop that should never
 * actually fire.
 *
 * **`provider-error` outcome:** classification lives in `../../llm/classifyRealProviderResult.ts`
 * (pure, offline-tested — `classifyRealProviderResult.spec.ts` — since this spec file itself is
 * real-key-gated and can't offer offline coverage on its own). `LocatorScenarioResult.providerError`
 * is set only when `runLocatorScenario`'s own try/catch caught a thrown gateway/provider error (a
 * safety block, an HTTP failure, a Gemini response with no usable candidates, ...) — never for a
 * normal `check()`-scored `pass: false`. The classifier checks it *before* `knownVariance`, so a
 * provider-error result can never be misread as a tool-choice variance. `provider-error` is NOT
 * accepted (same as `fail` and `timeout`) — accepted stays exactly `pass + known-variance`, per
 * `isAcceptedOutcome`.
 *
 * Neither provider's known-variance case is a gateway parsing bug: `OpenAiLlmGateway.spec.ts` and
 * `GeminiToolLlmGateway.spec.ts` already prove request mapping and response parsing are correct
 * for whatever tool call *is* returned. These results are about model tool *choice* — and for
 * Gemini specifically, "chose to look up first" is where it gets stuck: this file's own matrix is
 * single-turn by design (see the module-level note above), so there's no second turn here for the
 * model to continue past the lookup and actually resolve the target, regardless of the multi-turn
 * tool-result mapping being available in general. A known-variance result means exactly "hit the
 * documented alternate, accepted as known variance — not a strict pass", never "the move
 * completed" or "the refusal/executor-error path completed". A provider-error result is a
 * different kind of thing entirely — not a tool-choice question.
 *
 * `check()` in `verifyLocatorScenarios.ts` is NOT changed by any of this — offline scoring stays
 * exactly as strict as before. Only this file treats a `knownVariance`-documented alternate
 * outcome as non-fatal, and only for the exact shape `matches()` describes.
