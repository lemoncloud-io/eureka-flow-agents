 * without fabricating the rest — see `libs/agent/src/llm/pricing.ts` for how `estimatedCost` is
 * computed from these, and each gateway's own mapping comment for the exact provider field this
 * normalizes from.
 *
 * Every gateway is responsible for keeping `inputTokens`/`cachedInputTokens`/
 * `cacheWriteInputTokens`/`toolUseInputTokens` mutually disjoint, and `outputTokens`/
 * `reasoningTokens` mutually disjoint, BEFORE populating this shape — even when the provider's own
 * raw field nests one inside another (e.g. Gemini's `promptTokenCount` and OpenAI's `prompt_tokens`
 * both already include cached tokens; OpenAI's `completion_tokens` already includes
 * `reasoning_tokens`). That subtraction is deliberately done once, at the gateway boundary, so
 * every consumer downstream (aggregation, cost estimation, reporting) can just sum these fields
 * without needing provider-specific knowledge of which raw field nests which.
