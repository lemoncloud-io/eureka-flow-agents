# CanvasBinding — desktop implementation notes

`readGraph` + `updateNode` are what the [locator agent](../agents/locator/SPEC.md) uses (find a node,
move it) — the whole contract.

## Grounded primitives

| Need                      | Primitive                                                                                                                              | Where                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| read nodes                | `useCanvasStore.getState()` (`nodes` + `connections`), returned as `{ nodes, edges }`                                                  | `createDesktopCanvasBinding.ts` |
| edit one node (immediate) | `WorkflowCanvasRef.updateNode(id, Partial<NodeData>)` — guards `canModifyCanvas`, `saveCheckpoint()`s, then `setNodes`; no server call | `WorkflowCanvas.tsx`            |
| the name field            | `NodeData.customLabel`, falling back to the block's definition label                                                                   | `NodeBlock.tsx`                 |
| position                  | `NodeData.position` (`{ x, y }`)                                                                                                       | `@lemoncloud/eureka-flows-api`  |
| the ref to reach          | `canvasRef` on the editor page; `<WorkflowCanvas>` mounted below it                                                                    | `FlowEditorPage.tsx`            |

**Precedent:** `useSocketHandlers` already writes to the canvas through this ref
(`loadWorkflow` / `updateNodeFromServer`), so the seam is proven — the agent is the same pattern with a
tool call instead of a socket message.

## How the desktop impl works

It lives in the web app because it wraps `WorkflowCanvasRef` (app-side, not `libs/agent`). Two notes
that the source (linked above) makes concrete:

- **The write path reads `ref.current` lazily**, so it stays valid across canvas re-renders (and throws
  a clear error if the canvas isn't mounted). Reads go straight to `useCanvasStore` and don't need the ref.
- **`updateNode` shallow-merges**, so `position` is passed whole (never a partial axis), and `label` maps
  to `customLabel` — an empty string clears the override.

## Validation

The seam is exercised by the shipped locator agent: once the flow has an id, `FlowEditorPage` mounts the
`FlowAgentPanel` container, which builds this binding and drives the locator, handing the transcript to
the pure right-docked `<AgentPanel>` view. A chat command like "move Fetch 10px right" flows agent →
`updateNode` → the canvas re-renders immediately, with no server write. That proves the two things that
matter: external (non-React) code reaching the live canvas, and frontend-only label/position edits.

## Note on reads

The desktop canvas graph is store-sourced (`useCanvasStore`), so the binding reads it directly via
`useCanvasStore.getState()` rather than through the ref — a write is visible to the next read within the
same turn. Reads are still a per-call pull (no subscription); the binding re-reads on demand.
